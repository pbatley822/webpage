<h3>Pi Server</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank"><img src="images/rasbpi.jpg" class="fltleft" alt="raspberry pi logo" width="180" height="180"></a>
In my ever constant intellectual pursuits, I discovered a web page detailing information and steps on how to build a server utilizing a Raspberry Pi. The page contains a wealth of knowledge relating to the subject, but not all of it is current, as the page was posted several years ago. I forged ahead and decided to do independent research where pieces of information were missing or where files were outdated.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank"><img src="images/pibplus" class="fltright" alt="raspberry pi b+" width="225" height="180"></a>
The process included downloading and installing a specialized version of Linux tuned for the Raspberry Pi called Raspbian on to a micro SD card. Once the operating system is loaded on the card, it can be inserted into the Raspberry Pi. The system automatically runs its primary installation procedure and, after initial configuration is completed, a command prompt appears allowing direct access to the OS using Unix commands. Installing a secure shell program (SSH) called shellinabox allows remote access is possible to the command line. 
</p>
<p>
Once remote access is possible, administration and upkeep become much easier and more simplified. Once the necessary software tools have been uploaded, the server can be used to host website data; this webpage for example is hosted on my Raspberry Pi server. It can also be utilized to store and access content remotely using a service called Owncloud. Users can be added and administered from the graphical interface also accessible remotely. All this adds up to an extremely versatile and useful tool that can host content, including websites, using a small $35 computer.

<h3> C.L.I.P.P.</h3>
<p>
<a href="gallery.html"><img src="images/casablanca.jpg" class="fltleft" alt="A stock image created with the *.pgm file format" width="190" height="150"></a> 
As part of my C++ class, we were given this file that comprised of several numbers in a text document. When processed through an image program like Adobe PS or GIMP, it can be interpreted as an image. This particular kind of file, referred to as a .PGM file, has 5 elements: a file format("P2"); a comment(denoted by a '#'); a resolution(two numbers: columns and rows); a maximum grey value(applies to each pixel); and the pixels represented by individual integers. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format" target="_blank">Wiki entry about file formats</a>
</p>
<p>
With this knowledge about this and other file formats, we were tasked to perform several operations on these kinds of images: Rotate, resize, pixilize(distort), dilate and erode(morphological operations) and others. With this in mind, a logical path had to take place in order for me to solve the problems at hand. I had several steps to take to complete the task.<a href="gallery.html"><img src="images/operations.jpg" class="fltright" alt="Several operations have been performed on the image with C++" width="420" height="275"></a>
</p>
<p> 
After many laborious hours the first assignment we were given was completed. The concept seemed simple enough, but debugging the program turned out to be the biggest obstacle in my way. Small mistakes, many beginning programmers make, were plaguing me. We were given many more assignments throughout the semester and I continued to learn from my mistakes. Through these torments and tribulations, came my strong and confident programming skills that I posses today. 
 </p>

 <p> 
 These projects have taught me a lot about how to solve a problem logically, even if the problem wasn't necessarily one that was set before you initially. I believe the process of learning, programming skills or otherwise, is different for every one. I benefit from diving head first into the work and immersing myself with the task. In this regard, I have become a strong and capable learner.
